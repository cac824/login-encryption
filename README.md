# login-encryption
This is my third personal project. You sign in with your user and password and then log in afterward. After the sign-in process, it puts all the usernames and passwords into a file and encrypts it afterward when logging in, it decrypts the file and searches for the given user and password, and then encrypts it again.

I used the **cryptography** library for the encryption portion of the program and the **Tkinter** library for the GUI. This project uses a basic user authentication with security features.

**Improvements:**
I want to improve the encryption system and use a hashing system or RSA
